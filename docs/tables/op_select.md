#SELECT Queries

FOX_db has three different functions that run select queries. They provide functionality ranging from simple single-column selects right up to
multi-table inner joins. They also support aggregate functions, like SUM and COUNT, and provide sorting, grouping, paging, and offset.

One of the most powerful features of FOX_db's select functions is the result formatter. It parses the (often difficult to work with) results returned by the SQL server into conveniently formatted PHP arrays, objects, or combinations of both. For more information, see the results formatter section.

== Description ==

FoxFire is a data silo system that transparently adds caching, transactions, and multi-threaded capabilities. Plugin authors can use
FoxFire to greatly simplify designing their data schemas, and dramatically improve the performance of their applications. FoxFire
is not a hosted 3rd party solution - it only connects to db and caching servers you tell it to.

= IMPORTANT =
This is an ALPHA version of the plugin, released as a preview of what's to come. Do NOT install it on a live website.


= User Support =
We handle all user support through our wordpress.org support forum.
